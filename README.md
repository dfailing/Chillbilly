# CMAR Race Results - Shiny App
I developed an application using R Shiny that displays results and course records for the Cry Me A River! Trail Runs. You can use the app [here](https://runphd.shinyapps.io/CMAR/).

The code and dataset needed to deploy the application are all in this repository. I update the raw results data every year after the race, generate the formatted CSV files to send to [UltraSignup](https://ultrasignup.com/), and submit them.

If you believe there is an error in the data, feel free to send me an email at david.failing@gmail.com, or open an [Issue](../../issues) on this repository.
